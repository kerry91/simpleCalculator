When you submit your assignment, other learners in the course will review and grade your work. They will be looking at the following.
**Calculator functionality**

- When interacting with the calculator app in the UGL or VS Code:
- Did each button have a function?
- Did each button contain the required mathematical operator?
- Did each calculation provide the correct result as its output?

Can you suggest any improvements for the calculator app?
